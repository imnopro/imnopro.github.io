## Project 1: **[Hack The Box Write-ups]**

_Description:_  
This project focuses on documenting detailed walkthroughs of various Hack The Box machines, showcasing problem-solving skills in penetration testing and cybersecurity. Technologies used include `Nmap`, `Metasploit`, and `Burp Suite`.  
This Project is currently a work in progress, due to Hack-The-Box's content release policies. 

- Documented detailed walkthroughs of Hack The Box machines.
- Utilized Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
- Provided comprehensive write-ups covering exploitation steps, post-exploitation techniques, and machine analysis.
- Enhanced the repository with structured content, clear explanations, and diagrams for improved readability.
- Collaborated with the cybersecurity community to share findings and improve collective knowledge.

## Project 2: **[Proteus](https://github.com/imnopro/Proteus)**

_Description:_  
This project involved designing a fake laptop charger case for a USB Flipper to create a "bad charger" as a piece of social engineering hardware. I utilized `Duckyscript`, `PowerShell`, and `Batch Files`.  
* [Project Repository](https://github.com/imnopro/Proteus)

- Designed a fake laptop charger case for a USB Flipper to simulate a "bad charger" for social engineering.
- Developed and implemented Duckyscript, PowerShell, and Batch Files to create and control the malicious functionality.
- Documented the design and development process, including hardware setup and script functionality.
- Provided detailed explanations and usage instructions for the fake charger and its components.
- Shared insights and findings with the cybersecurity community to enhance awareness of social engineering techniques and hardware-based attacks.


## Project 2: **[Odysseus](https://github.com/imnopro/Odysseus)**
_Description:_  
This project showcases the integration of `msfvenom` and `Advanced Installer` to create a software package that includes an embedded reverse shell payload. The objective was to demonstrate how payloads can be embedded within an installer and executed to establish a connection to a remote listener.

* [Project Repository](https://github.com/imnopro/Odysseus)

- **Generated Malicious Payload:** Utilized `msfvenom` to create a malicious Windows executable with a reverse shell payload. 
- **Created Installer:** Used `Advanced Installer` to package the malicious `.exe` into a professional-looking MSI installer to decrease visibility and obfuscate. 
- **Documentation:** Provided a comprehensive guide detailing the process of generating the payload, packaging it with an installer, and running the demonstration. 
- **Educational Value:** Aimed to educate others on integrating payloads with software installers and understanding potential security implications. Shared insights to help enhance cybersecurity awareness and practices.
